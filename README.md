# Developing-CI-CD-process-for-a-NodeJS-backend-application

Prepare a design and architecture document to develop CI/CD process for a NodeJS backend application. The architecture should consider the complete lifecycle of CI/CD such as SCM trigger, build, test, code quality, server instantiation, containerized deployment, scalability. The document should include the CI/CD architecture diagram and description of all components of CI/CD pipeline. Please include pseudo code wherever necessary.

1. SCM trigger: First, you need to set up your source code management (SCM) system, such as Git, and configure Jenkins to watch for changes in the repository. You can do this by creating a Jenkinsfile in the root of your project and specifying the repository URL and branch.

 2. Build: Next, you can set up a build step in your Jenkinsfile to compile your code and run any necessary tests or linters. This can be done using a build tool like Grunt or Gulp, or with a simple shell script.

 3. Test: After the build step, you can add a step to run your test suite. This can be done using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest.

 4. Code quality: You can also add a step to check the code quality of your application using a tool like ESLint or JSHint.
 5. Server instantiation: If your application requires a server to be running, you can set up a step to start the server before running the tests.

 6. Containerized deployment: Once the tests have passed, you can set up a step to build a Docker container image of your application and push it to a container registry like Docker Hub.

 7. Scalability: Finally, you can set up a step to deploy the containerized version of your application to a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes, which will allow you to scale the application as needed.

Here is an example Jenkinsfile that defines these steps:

```
pipeline {
  agent any

  stages {
    stage('SCM') {
      steps {
        checkout([$class: 'GitSCM', branches: [[name: '*/master']], doGenerateSubmoduleConfigurations: false, extensions: [], submoduleCfg: [], userRemoteConfigs: [[credentialsId: 'my-credentials', url: 'https://github.com/my-repo.git']]])
      }
    }
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        sh 'npm install'
      }
    }
    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        sh 'npm test'
      }
    }
    stage('Code Quality') {
      steps {
        sh 'npm run lint'
      }
    }
    stage('Server Instantiation') {
      steps {
        sh 'npm start &'
      }
    }
    stage('Containerized Deployment') {
      steps {
        sh 'docker build -t my-app .'
        sh 'docker push my-app'
      }
    }
    stage('Scalability') {
      steps {
        sh 'kubectl apply -f my-app-deployment.yml'
      }
    }
  }
}
```






create my-app-deployment.yml file for  the above 
Here is an example my-app-deployment.yml file that you can use to deploy your containerized Node.js backend application to a Kubernetes cluster:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app-deployment
  labels:
    app: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: my-app
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          env:
            - name: NODE_ENV
              value: production
```              
This deployment file specifies the following:

The deployment should have 3 replicas of the container.
The deployment should use the my-app container image.
The container should listen on port 8080.
The container should run in the production environment.
You can customize this file to suit your specific needs, such as changing the number of replicas or the container port.





create Containerized Deployment docker file for above
Here is an example Dockerfile that you can use to build a container image for your Node.js backend application:

```
FROM node:14-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

This Dockerfile does the following:

Uses the node:14-alpine image as the base image.
Sets the working directory to /app.
Copies the package.json and package-lock.json files to the working directory.
Installs the dependencies listed in the package.json file.
Copies the rest of the application code to the working directory.
Exposes port 8080.
Runs the npm start command to start the application.
You can customize this file to suit your specific needs, such as changing the base image or the command to start the application
