# Developing-CI-CD-process-for-a-NodeJS-backend-application

Task:1

Priority: *High*

Statement: 

Prepare a design and architecture document to develop CI/CD process for a NodeJS backend application. The architecture should consider the complete lifecycle of CI/CD such as SCM trigger, build, test, code quality, server instantiation, containerized deployment, scalability. The document should include the CI/CD architecture diagram and description of all components of CI/CD pipeline. Please include pseudo code wherever necessary.

#### Here is brief description of the solution as per the above statement.

1. Source Code  trigger: First, we need to set up our source code management (SCM) system, Git in this senario, and then we will configure Jenkins to watchout for changes of any code, feature codes etc in the repository. Now We can do this by creating a Jenkinsfile in the root of our project and specifying the repository URL and designated branch.

 2. Build Step : Next, we will set up a build step in our Jenkinsfile to compile our code and run any necessary tests. This can be done using a  ```shell script```.

 3. Testing : After the build step, we can add a step to run our test suite. This can be done using a testing framework wirttenin  ```Mocha```.

 4. Code quality : We can  add a step to check the code quality of our nodejs application using a tool like ESLint or JSHint.
 5. Server instantiation: If we  application requires a server to be running, we can set up a step to start the server before running the tests.

 6. Containerized for deployment: Once the tests have passed,we can set up a step to build a Docker container image of our application and push it to a container registry - Docker Hub.

 7. Scalability step : Finally, we can set up a step to deploy the containerized version of our application to a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes, which will allow us to scale the application as needed.

Here is an example Jenkinsfile  code that defines these steps:

```
pipeline {
  agent any

  stages {
    stage('SCM') {
      steps {
        checkout([$class: 'GitSCM', branches: [[name: '*/master']], doGenerateSubmoduleConfigurations: false, extensions: [], submoduleCfg: [], userRemoteConfigs: [[credentialsId: 'sabir-credentials', url: 'https://github.com/sabir-repo.git']]])
      }
    }
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        sh 'npm install'
      }
    }
    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        sh 'npm test'
      }
    }
    stage('Code Quality') {
      steps {
        sh 'npm run lint'
      }
    }
    stage('Server Instantiation') {
      steps {
        sh 'npm start &'
      }
    }
    stage('Containerized Deployment') {
      steps {
        sh 'docker build -t sabir-app .'
        sh 'docker push sabir-app'
      }
    }
    stage('Scalability') {
      steps {
        sh 'kubectl apply -f sabir-app-deployment.yml'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here is an example Dockerfile that we can use to build a container image for our Node.js backend application:

```
FROM node:14-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

This **Dockerfile** does the following:

Uses the node:14-alpine image as the base image.
Sets the working directory to /app.
Copies the package.json and package-lock.json files to the working directory.
Installs the dependencies listed in the package.json file.
Copies the rest of the application code to the working directory.
Exposes port 8080.
Runs the npm start command to start the application.


**Kubernetes:**


Here is  sabir-app-deployment.yml file that you can use to deploy your containerized Node.js backend application to a Kubernetes cluster:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sabir-app-deployment
  labels:
    app: sabir-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sabir-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sabir-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: sabir-app
          image: sabir-app
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          env:
            - name: NODE_ENV
              value: production
```              
This deployment file specifies the following:

The deployment should have 3 replicas of the container.
It should use the sabir-app container image.
The container should listen on port 8080.
The container should run in the production environment.

We can customize this file to suit our specific needs, such as changing the number of replicas or the container port.


*I hope this is help full, there more details i can elaborate but to keep it simple , this is the my solution the provided task*
